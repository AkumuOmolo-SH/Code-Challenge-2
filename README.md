# Code-Challenge-2
This repository contains my solutions for Code Challenge 2. In this challenge, we were tasked with building a simple Event Guest List Manager using JavaScript. The goal was to demonstrate our understanding of working with forms, events, and DOM manipulation. All interactivity and updates to the page were handled using JavaScript, without refreshing the browser.

**#Guest List Manager**

This project is a simple web application designed to help users manage a guest list for an event. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it enables users to add, remove, toggle RSVP status for guests, and see the time a guest was added — all dynamically, without refreshing the page.

**#Features**

- Add a guest to a list using the input and add button.
- Remove a guest from the list.
- Limit guest list to 10 people (with alert).
- Mark guests as “Attending” or “Not Attending”
- Add a timestamp for when the guest was added
- Styled with custom CSS

**#Technologies Used**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation and event handling)

**#Project Setup**

This repository includes a JavaScript file, a CSS file, and an HTML file for the Guest List Manager application.

**#How to run the solutions**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Open the index.html file in your browser.
4. Use the app (Add upto 10 guests, use the add and remove features)
